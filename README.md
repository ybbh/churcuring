AI  -->  Churcuring  -->  MuduDB
```

Churcuring is an **AI-native computation and software construction framework** that converts natural language into *
*formal specifications**, compiles them into **hierarchical state machines**, and generates **executable logic and
database access code** in a structured, verifiable, and infinitely scalable manner.

The name *Churcuring* honors the **Church–Turing** tradition, reflecting the system’s goal of bridging formal
computation, symbolic structure, and modern large language models.

## Key Features

- Natural language → formal, executable specifications
- UML activity diagrams and ER models as **compilable specs**
- Hierarchical, infinitely decomposable state machines
- LLM-generated state transition functions
- Explicit, controlled database access via MuduDB
- Formal verification of state machine correctness
- Clear separation of logic, state, and side effects

## Core Pipeline

```
Natural Language
      ↓
Structured / Formal Specification
      ↓
State Machine (Σ)
      ↓
Transition Functions (λ) + Database Access ([#])
```

Churcuring treats software as **structured state space**, not ad-hoc code.

---

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Specification Layer `{}`

- UML Activity Diagrams
- Entity–Relationship (ER) Diagrams
- Fully structured and normalized
- Can be authored manually or generated by LLMs
- Acts as the single source of truth

---

### 2. State Machine Layer `Σ`

- Specifications compile directly into state machine code
- Each state can be:
    - A terminal state
    - A pure transition function
    - A nested sub-state machine
- Supports unlimited hierarchical refinement
- Designed for formal verification (safety, liveness, correctness)

---

### 3. Function & Data Layer `λ [#]`

- Terminal state transitions may be described in natural language
- LLMs generate:
    - Transition function code
    - Database read/write procedures
- All side effects are explicit and isolated
- Persistent state is managed via **MuduDB**

## Symbol Legend

| Symbol | Meaning                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| §      | AI prompt / natural language input   |
| `{}`   | Structured specification             |
| Σ      | State machine                        |
| λ      | Transition function / Mudu procedure |
| `[#]`  | Database                             |

## Typical Workflows

### Natural Language → State Machine

```
Text → Spec → Compiled State Machine
```

### State Refinement

- Activity diagrams refine existing state machines
- Any state can be expanded into a sub-state machine

### Natural Language → Code

```
Terminal State Description
        ↓
LLM-generated Transition Function
        ↓
Executable Code
```

## Formal Verification

Each state machine produced by Churcuring is suitable for:

- Model checking
- Reachability analysis
- Safety and liveness proofs

Verification is a first-class design goal, not an afterthought.

---

## Vision

Churcuring proposes a **new AI-centric computation architecture** where:

- AI generates **structure**, not just text
- Structure compiles into **reliable software**
- Systems remain **auditable, scalable, and verifiable**

It unifies natural language, formal methods, state machines, and databases into a single coherent pipeline.

---

## Project Status

Churcuring is an **open research and engineering framework**.  
Interfaces, compilers, and runtime backends are under active development.
